# Music Classification using YouTube comment data based on LDA

## Background
The existing music recommendation system mainly recommends music to users based on genre. However, since the preference for music is determined not only by genre but also by various characteristics, simple genre-based recommendations have limitations in satisfying the diverse tastes of listeners. 

To solve this problem, there have been existing studies that have been approached by setting new standards (lyrics based on lyrics, lyrics interpretation based, etc.) other than genres, but there have still been problems such as poor relevance and lack of data. 

## Research Objective
This research uses the **YouTube Comments** data to solve the limitations of the existing music classification system. The algorithm used in this project is the ``Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)`` technique, which is a probability model for what topics exist in each document for a given document. 
Based on the YouTube comment data and the LDA algorithm, I classified the music by topic by comprehensively grasping the atmosphere of the music.
